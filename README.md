# Introduction

This repository exists as a data repository for the reesarch work conducted by
Erik Whiting and Dr. Soma Datta, both of the University of Houston - Clear Lake,
College of Science and Engineering on the paper titled:
***Performance Testing and Agile Software Development: A Systematic Review***

# About the Data

The data that exists here can be found in the paper (from here on referred to as *the SLR*)
as well as the methods for reproducging the data. This reposistory is for quick and public
access to the data.

# Brief Description of How Data was Obtained

Like with most SLRs, the articles gathered for this project were taken from various
databases such as ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. The databases were given
queries containing keywords (noted in the SLR) and then reviewed by both authors to
determine relevance to the SLR.

# Explanation of Files

## FinalArticlesSelected.xlsx

This is the main data file for the projected and contains several worksheets:

### Removed Studies

This list contains all articles returned by the database queries that were
ultimately deemed irrelevant. The sheet contains the article name, authors,
publication year, and in which phase the SLR authors deemed the paper irrelevant.

### Resarch Questions

This list contains a mapping of which paper answered which research question
and the answer provided by that paper.

### Selected Studies

This is the master list of studies that were analyzed for all figures and
conclusions in the SLR. This worksheet contains the name, author(s), and 
publication year of the paper and which database it was taken from. The
worksheet also contains notes left by the authors as well as "Article ID"
assigned to each paper for reference in data analysis.

### High Level Paper Data

This page lists each paper's solution type, perf. challenges, agile
challenges, app domain, and solution type. Each of these categories was
defined and discerned by the authors (method is described in SLR).

### Analysis Sheets

The remaining sheets contain different ways of slicing and analyzing
the data as well as graphs that were used as figures in the SLR. The
formulas and other pieces of data are available to the work can be
reproduced.

## removedPapers.txt

This text file was the primary author's scratch file while going
through the different reviews. The same informaiton can be gathered
from the FinalArticlesSelected.xlsx file, but this one is included
in the spirit of full disclosure.


## ResultsFiltering.xlsx

This spreadsheet contains all article informaiton, content notes,
and comments on relevance to the SLR made by the authors. This
file documents the rationale and reason each paper was eventually
included or discarded from the SLR.

The file is broken down first by the database in which the paper
was gathered, and then by which phase of literature review
the notes were made on a particular file.
